# Learning React

The Modern React with Redux course on Udemy.com is an excellent way to learn React. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to try React for the first time. The course guides you through making these four little applications.

To run any of them, simply cd into the directory of one of the apps and
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
And then the app will be live at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### YouTube App
This application is basically an extremely simplified remake of YouTube. It even uses the YouTube API to show you the same videos you would see if you were on YouTube.

This introduces the basic structure of a React application such as using components.

#### Book App
This application lets you select pre-populated book titles and shows you more details about them.

This introduces Redux.

#### Weather App
This application lets you look up Canadian cities and will show you little charts representing weather data for that city, including a little Google maps image to make sure it retrieved the right city.

This introduces actions that return promises.

#### Blog App
As the name implies, this little application lets you make blog posts with categories. It uses an API created by the course's instructor to store and retrieve the posts.

This introduces routing.
